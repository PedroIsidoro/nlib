Kitchen for Nodeca base classes & helpers. Since our goal is NOT making framework,
some solutions can be simplified and not flexible. If some part looks universal, we can
move it to separate micromodule after stabilization.

This module is also responsible for syndication all Nodeca dependencies (to simplify template
of main & each subproject).

See docs for details: http://nodeca.github.com/nodeca-lib/
